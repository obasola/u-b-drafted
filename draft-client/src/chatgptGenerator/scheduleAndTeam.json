Create a vue 3 CRUD app using <script setup lang="ts">, 
typescript, nodemon, pinia, axios, vue-router, and primevue.
Use components for the CRUD actions and PRIMEVUE DataTable 
for the List component, and PrimeVue Inputs for the create 
and edit components. The List component should use a primevue Datatable 
and Create / Edit components should use primevue input elements. 

how would I design a Vue 3 CRUD app with <script setup lang="ts"> 
using Pinia, Vue-Router, Typescript, vue components, and PrimeVue.
The List component should use primevue data table and provide link to detail component on row click.

The Create and Edit components show include a dropdown list for foreign keys when present.
Data is retrieved from a database using axios and stored in a pinia store and then retrieved to populate the components.
A Master / Detail component need to be created to show Schedule and team when the row is clicked from the list page.
Use the following interface for the crud pages:

interface Schedule {
    id: number;
    teamID: number;
    opponentId: number;
    scheduleWeek: number;
    gameDate: Date;
    gameCity: string;
    gameStateProvince: TemplateStringsArray;
    gameCountry: string;
    gameLocation: string;
    opponentConference: string;
    opponentDivision: string;
    winLostFlag: string;
    homeOrAway: string;
  }
  
  export default interface Team {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    conference: string;
  }
